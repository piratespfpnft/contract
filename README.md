# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
npx hardhat verify --network goerli 0x428d6BbeAf1D0D55497Bdd7107CB3994B2C88d57```
